# MRI Image Analysis: Brain Tumor Detection using CNNs

This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CNN model is trained on a dataset of MRI scans labeled with tumor and non-tumor classes to automate the process of tumor detection.

## Features

- **MRI Image Preprocessing**: Includes data preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **CNN Model Architecture**: Details of the convolutional neural network architecture used for tumor detection.
- **Training**: Instructions on how to train the CNN model on your dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Methods for evaluating the model's performance, including metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Guidelines for deploying the trained model for inference on new MRI scans.
- **Visualization**: Tools and techniques for visualizing MRI images and model predictions.

## Requirements

Specify the necessary dependencies and libraries required to run the project:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- (Add any other dependencies specific to your project)

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your MRI dataset and organize it appropriately.
2. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model using the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using predefined metrics.
4. **Inference**: Deploy the model to make predictions on new MRI images.
